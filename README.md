This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Payments maintenance mode (Stripe)

You can temporarily disable Stripe checkout session creation (both individual consultations and group conferences) while doing maintenance/testing.

### Environment variables

- `PAYMENTS_MAINTENANCE_ENABLED`: `true` or `false`
- `PAYMENTS_MAINTENANCE_KEY`: a long random string used as a bypass password via URL query param
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENTS_MAINTENANCE_ENABLED`: `true` or `false` (optional, used only to show the maintenance banner in the UI without calling the API)

### How it works

- When maintenance is enabled, the API endpoints will return `503` unless a correct bypass key is provided:
  - `/api/create-checkout-session?maintenance_key=...`
  - `/api/create-checkout-session-conferinta?maintenance_key=...`

- To bypass in the browser during testing, open the checkout page with:
  - `?maintenance_key=<PAYMENTS_MAINTENANCE_KEY>`

Users without the key will see a maintenance message and will be prevented from starting payment.
